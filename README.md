# Tunguska_fall_model
Matlab software for describing the fall of the TCB (Tunguska Cosmic Body) using the pancake model until the airburst. After the airburst, it describes the trajectory to the ground of a fragment that survives the airburst phase. 
The starting point is in the "Settings.txt" file; default values, as the path, can be changed. You must install Matlab on your PC (version 2019 or higher). To use it, read the paper Carbognani et al., Computation of a possible Tunguska's strewn field, https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13620.
